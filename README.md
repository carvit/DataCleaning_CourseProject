Hi!

This is the *Getting and Cleaning Data* course project.

In the project directory you can find following files:

*  run_analysis.R - resulting script, which performs required functionality
*  CodeBook.md - the description of the getting and cleaning process
*  out.txt - required tidy dataset

Please check the full description of the data at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones .

Grade me mercifully :-)

Best regards,
Robert
